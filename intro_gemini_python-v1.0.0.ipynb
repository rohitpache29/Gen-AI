    "Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro Vision models.\n",

    "### Vertex AI Gemini API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vertex AI Gemini API provides a unified interface for interacting with Gemini models. There are two Gemini 1.0 Pro models available in the Gemini API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gemini 1.0 Pro model** (`gemini-1.0-pro`): Designed to handle natural language tasks, multi-turn text and code chat, and code generation.\n",
    "- **Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model** (`gemini-1.0-pro-vision`): Supports multimodal prompts. You can include text, images, and video in your prompt requests and get text or code responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can interact with the Gemini API using the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use [Vertex AI Studio](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio) for quick testing and command generation\n",
    "- Use cURL commands\n",
    "- Use the Vertex AI SDK\n",

      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the molecules in the air.

This scattering causes the blue light to be scattered in all directions, which is why we see a blue sky.\n",
